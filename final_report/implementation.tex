\section{Implementation}
The STEM data produced by eBird came in \texttt{Rdata} format. Thus, our first step is transforming that data into CSV format. We then read the data into Python where we generate the averaged time-series data for each bounding box (with the number of boxes as a parameter). 

Our network inference implementation then chooses a time-window of roughly 2 months and computes the cross-correlation for all candidate edges (which are the $8n$ 8-neighborhood edges noted above, minus any with incident nodes that have been filtered due to low population). We then perform the Fisher transformation of the correlations, and perform the significance test. Thus, the general process is as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Filter out zero-population and low-action ($p_{active} < 0.05$) nodes
\item Compute spatially localized cross-correlations with lags $1\dots T, (T=10)$
\item Use significance test to determine if cross-correlations are statistically valid
\item Keep valid edges
\end{enumerate}

The edges generated for each time period are returned as a list of tuples which can then be plotted on a map.

\section{Results}
We generated a graph of bird movement over each a series of 2-month windows created by rolling each window 2 weeks at a time.
The edges have transparency based on the average magnitude of the derivative, over the window, for both endpoints.
The underlying color represents the calculated bird presence from the data.
Edges with less movement--denoted by less change during the time window--will have considerably lighter colored edges in the graph.
The full series of generated graphs can be found in \ref{appendicks}.
