% The \author macro works with any number of authors. There are two commands
% used to separate the names and addresses of multiple authors: \And and \AND.
%
% Using \And between authors leaves it to \LaTeX{} to determine where to break
% the lines. Using \AND forces a linebreak at that point. So, if \LaTeX{}
% puts 3 of 4 authors names on the first line, and the last on the second
% line, try using \AND instead of \And before the third author name.

\begin{abstract}
eBird is a citizen science application that employs a statistical model to predict the spatial and temporal distribution of bird species throughout the United States. However, they do not offer a migration model. We discuss the process of `network inference,' initially developed to discover implicit networks in the brain from time-series data. We then discuss how we efficiently adapt this process to bird presence data, and analyze its suitability for detecting bird migration networks.

\section{Related Work}
The data from eBird was already used by Hurlbert et al. in an investigation of red vireo migration; wherein they discovered a direct correlation between the migration patterns and the average temperature of a location \cite{hurlbert}. A more predictive migration study, using Hidden Markov models on synthetic data, was performed by Sheldon, et. al \cite{conf/nips/SheldonEK07}, but only published results on a single bird species, without using data generated by the STEM model. 

\appendix
\section{Appendix A}\label{appendicks}
The following plots demonstrate the migration patterns extracted using our approach.
Here each time window considered was 2-months wide and stepped over the entire year by 2 weeks at a time.
Each graphic is displayed over a contour plot generated from the STEM-generated data, which represents the actual predicted bird presence.
