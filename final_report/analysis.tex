\section{Future Work}
Qualitatively analyzing networks gives a limited picture. Quantitative measures can leverage the data more deeply. While betweenness centrality could identify some important `bottleneck' nodes, we believe that a maximum-flow measure would be more suitable, as this could also identify important sources and sinks if modeled correctly.

The most important future work, were this to become a publication, is validation of the produced data with well-known existing migration patterns, as well as further analysis with a wide spread of bird species. Generated networks are still strongly correlated with the actual bird presence data, so it's quite possible that there are far better metrics than cross-correlation to establish edge weights. Important insights could most likely be drawn from the signal-processing community.
